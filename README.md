# SuperStore_Sales_Dashboard
This project features an interactive dashboard built on retail sales data from a fictional online store. 
It captures detailed transactions across multiple regions, product categories, customer segments, and time periods.

The Super Store dataset simulates retail sales data for a fictional superstore.
It is widely used for data visualization, dashboard development, and business intelligence training. 
Ideal for practicing data analysis, exploring KPIs, and building interactive dashboards with tools like Tableau, Power BI, or Python.

Due to GitHub’s limitations with Power BI integration, the interactive dashboard cannot be embedded directly. Instead, this repository includes screenshots to showcase the dashboard layout and functionality.

If you'd like to explore how the dashboard was built, the original .pbix file is also provided. You can open it in Power BI Desktop to view the data model, visuals, and DAX calculations.
# Presentation of the dashboard

The first page contains an Overview of the data with feature like the total product sold or the overall profit.
A featured KPI tracks the delivery delay, allowing users to observe how shipping performance varies across different shipping modes. By adjusting the selected shipping method, the dashboard dynamically highlights changes in average delivery time, offering insights into operational efficiency.

The second page is an interactive map which shows different features by geographic location. You can add filter too.
Users can explore sales, profit, or order volume across states. The map supports dynamic filtering.

The third page presents a series of performance graphs that highlight sales and profit across various dimensions—including state, product, and category. These visualizations help users identify top-performing areas and uncover opportunities for improvement.

Two circular diagrams act as interactive filters, allowing users to refine the data displayed in the graphs. Additionally, a "Best/Worst" toggle button lets users switch the view to focus on either the highest or lowest performing segments, making it easy to compare and analyze business outcomes.
